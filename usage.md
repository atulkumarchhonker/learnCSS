## &#9873; Usage Guide

This usage guide will give explanation about creating and using CSS Styles in the HTML.

### &#10022; Creating CSS File

- CSS files can be created using simple text editors or professional code editors.
- For creating a CSS file, First open the new file in the your preferred editor.
- Write CSS styles with selector and properties. Which you can find in further topics.
- Then save it as **`filename.css`** with **`UTF-8`** encoding. 
- When it comes to editing an existing CSS file, Then open the file in the editor to make changes. Finally save to apply styles to the HTML elements.

### &#10022; Using CSS File

- Once CSS file is created then it can be link to the existing HTML document.
- Refer [Link Tag](https://github.com/ag-sanjjeev/HTML-Notes/blob/master/tags/link-tag.md) and Use it for linking the CSS files to the HTML document.
- Save the HTML document to apply changes.
- Then **`select the html file`** and run by hitting the **`ENTER`** button 
- Or by **`open`** or by **`open with`** option menu associated with that selected file.
- After that above actions will be reflected on the HTML document.
- Instead of CSS files, You can directly write styles for the HTML document via [Style Tag](https://github.com/ag-sanjjeev/HTML-Notes/blob/master/tags/style-tag.md) or via `style=""` attribute of the each element.
- The best practice is, Write separate file for CSS Styles to make HTML document clean and neat in the code. And also it gives the code re-usability.
